    <h1>Hello, Everybody!</h1>
    
    <p>Its me, CyberPlox, your man for the show. It's our first meeting so lets make it short and and simple. I, while learning, am thinking of making this site into a log for my continous <strong>Grinding with Coffee</strong> sessions. Now then, without a due, Lets Begin!</p>
    
    <img src="images/lets-start-over.jpg" alt="A journey begins" />
    
    <p>Below this lists the main order of things to be followed through while progressing with this log:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Completion of basics of web technologies,</li>
      <li>Integration of CSS for intricate styling,</li>
      <li>Addition of JS for both font-end as well as back-end tweaking,</li>
      <li>Progression of server-side-scripting,</li>
      <li>Acknowlegdement to full-stack development.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>These can be considered some <strong>Points of honor</strong>, handpicked in the hopes of successful breakthrough in understanding development process and getting closer to being a developer.
      <strong>P.S.</strong> The main idea and context of this site will not be changed regardless the updates that it may witness in the coming future, moreover there will be additional resources and links to some of my other projects and the log regarding their progress. It can also be said that most of the changes will be recorded in this site.</p>
    
    <p>For further information <a href="https:www.github.com/CyberPlox/">This is my GitHub profile</a>, and you are always welcome to mess around, just don't break anything.</p>
